# Bey-Slay

You are given an api.js file that exports an array of objects that look like this:
  > `{ "id": 1, "name": "All Day Slay", "img": "https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6gb7cN7bwDxAbnS8/giphy.gif", "favorite": false }`

# Deliverables:

-- Render a list of all Beyonce images

-- When a User clicks on a Beyonce image in `BeyContainer` it should change the `favorite` key of that object to `true`, which should then add that Beyonce to the FavoritesContainer. 

-- When a User clicks on a Beyonce image in the `Favorites` container, it should change the `favorite` key of that object to `false`, which should then remove it from the FavoritesContainer and send an alert saying "I got a hot sauce in my bag, swag"

- Add a create form so a user can add their own gif to the Index

- Add a search form for the entire application

- This means that when I search for the name of a gif, both my Index AND my Favorites should filter through their lists



# Hint

- The gif below will give you an idea of what the app should look like
- Look up the window.alert() function
